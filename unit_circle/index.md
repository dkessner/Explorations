title: Unit Circle
---

This is a demonstration of the sine function.  Remember that $$\sin(\theta)$$ is
defined to be the $$y\text{-value}$$ of the point on the unit circle defined by
angle $$\theta$$, measured counter-clockwise from the $$x\text{-axis}$$.  Here's
another way to think of it: $$\sin\theta$$ is the projection of the clock hand on
the $$y\text{-axis}$$.
