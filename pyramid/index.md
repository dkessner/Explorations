title: Pyramid Volume
---

The volume of a pyramid is $$\frac{1}{3}$$ the volume of a prism of the same
height.  This demonstration actually shows a cube being decomposed into 6
pyramids, so each pyramid has volume $$\frac{1}{6}$$ of the volume of the cube,
or $$\frac{1}{3}$$ the volume of a half-cube, which is the prism with the same
height as the pyramid.
