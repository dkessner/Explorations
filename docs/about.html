<p>These webpages and programs are fully dependent on open source software. They are developed, maintained and hosted on various flavors of the <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/">Linux</a> operating system and edited with the <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> text editor.</p>
<p>The webpages are created with <a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a>, a swiss-army knife tool for converting documents between different formats. This project is also a proof-of-concept using Makefiles to turn Pandoc into a minimal static site generator.</p>
<p>The page content is written in <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">Markdown</a> (a simplified markup language) with embedded <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a> for the mathematical equations.</p>
<p>Interactive programs are written in <a href="http://www.processing.org">Processing</a>, a simplified Java language and framework for creating computer graphics programs. The programs are are embedded in the web pages using <a href="http://processingjs.org/">Processing.js</a>.</p>
