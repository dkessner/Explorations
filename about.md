## About these pages

These webpages and programs are fully dependent on open source software.  They
are developed, maintained and hosted on various flavors of the
[Linux](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/) operating system and edited with the
[Vim](http://www.vim.org/) text editor.

The webpages are created with [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/), a swiss-army knife
tool for converting documents between different formats.  This project is also
a proof-of-concept using Makefiles to turn Pandoc into a minimal static site
generator.

The page content is written in
[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) (a simplified
markup language) with embedded [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) for the
mathematical equations.

Interactive programs are written in [Processing](http://www.processing.org), a
simplified Java language and framework for creating computer graphics programs.
The programs are are embedded in the web pages using
[Processing.js](http://processingjs.org/).
